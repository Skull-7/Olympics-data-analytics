# Olympics Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on performing data analytics on Olympics data extracted from the dataset `athlete_events.csv` and `noc_regions.csv`. The goal is to analyze various aspects of Olympic participation, including athlete demographics, medal distribution by country, and more.

## Dataset
- **athlete_events.csv**: Contains information about athletes participating in Olympic events, including details such as name, nationality, sport, event, and medal won.
- **noc_regions.csv**: Provides a mapping between National Olympic Committee (NOC) codes and the corresponding country names.

## Tools Used
- This project was developed using Google Colab, an online platform for running Python code in Jupyter notebooks.
- Libraries used include pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

## Project Structure
- The analysis is structured in a Jupyter notebook format (`Olympics_Data_Analytics.ipynb`), detailing each step of the data analysis process.
- After cleaning the data, three files named `Athlete_data` were created in different formats: JSON, XLSX, and CSV, to provide versatility in data consumption.
- Additionally, a dataset named `Win Loss Data By Countries` was generated to analyze the total number of medals won by countries. This dataset is also available in JSON, XLSX, and CSV formats.

## Contents
- **Data Cleaning**: The notebook details the steps taken to clean and preprocess the raw data, handle missing values, and ensure data consistency.
- **Data Analysis**: Various analyses were conducted, including demographic insights into athletes, trends in Olympic participation over time, and a breakdown of medal counts by country.
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib was used to create visual representations of the analyzed data, including bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Exported Data**: The cleaned datasets and analysis results were exported into JSON, XLSX, and CSV formats for further exploration and integration with other tools.

## Conclusion
The project sheds light on patterns and trends within Olympic data, providing valuable insights into athlete demographics, country-wise performance, and changes in Olympic participation over time. These findings can be leveraged for further research, decision-making, and exploration in the realm of sports analytics.
